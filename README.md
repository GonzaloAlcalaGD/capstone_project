## Project description

As a Data Engineer you will need to design and implement some part of the data platform for a data analytics team. Customers have various sources but data is not unified, so we also need to think about data structure. We have 3 sources of data that need to be ingested. These sources are updated every day around 11PM. 
 
We have following sources:
RDBMS (Postresql, or MySQL)
Parquet files
Json files

1. RDBMS tables:
    - Transaction
	    - id int,
	    - Customer_id int,
	    - Transaction_ts timestamp,
	    - Amount int
    - Customer
	    - Id int,
	    - First_name int,
	    - Last_name int,
	    - Phone_number int,
	    - Address string

2. JSON structure:
    - {
        ‘id’:1,
        “ts”: 2022--06-06T22:06:06, 
        “Customer_first_name” : “test”
        “Customer_last_name”: “test”,
        “Amount”: 1000
        “Type” : “0” # 0 - in_store, 1-online	
        }

3. Parquet structure:
	- Id: int 
	- Customer: Struct
		- First_name: String
		- Last_name: String
	- Amount: int
	- ts: timestamp,
	- Store_id: int

### Stages:

1. Create data generators : Create data using the 3 formats. Create around 100 entries for each format and for a total of 3 days. 
2. Integrate tools: You can use RDBMS (Postresql, or MySQL) + Spark locally, or you can also choose Docker Desktop or Cloud. Once tools are installed and can communicate please perform the following aggregations in the Aggregations section, and save in the target folder (simulating the Data Warehouse). 
3. Install Airflow or integrate in Docker / Cloud, then schedule the Spark execution to Aggregate the data of the first day in one hour, next day the next hour, last day the following hour. 
4. Install HDFS or use Docker / Cloud and configure spark jobs to save the resulting data there. 

### Aggregations:
 
Build next tables:
1. Count and sum amount transactions for each type (online or offline(in store)) for day
2. Count and sum amount transactions for each store for day
3. Count and sum amount transactions for each city (city can be extracted from address) for day

### Think about:
**Is it convenient to ingest all fields to the data warehouse?**

**Is the source data going to be there forever? What about the data in DWH?**
 
**What do you do if you have a transaction that is present in more than one format ?** 

**What happens If you have data in the DWH for 2 years and you have a request from the client to calculate a new attribute/aggregation?**

### Concepts:
    - PII (personal identifiable information) 
    - TTL (time to live) Retention policy 1 yrs 
    - Duplicates (remover / take last /aggregate both / etc) 
    - Backfill 
    - Null policy 

### Optional:
    - Add a few duplicates and apply 3 techniques: Drop duplicates, take latest, add count column 
    - Create a fourth dataset with customers data and enrich the unified dataset with Customer information where needed.

### Deliverable:
    - Create a personal github project. Add readme with detailed description of the project.

**Docker dekstop resources**
For proper operation it is recommended to configure the advanced Docker resources as described below: 
- CPUs : 6
- Memory : 12.00 GB
- Swap : 1 GB
- Disk image size: 72GB

## Geting started
In order to execute the project you need to have the following tools installed in your local machine.
1. [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)


### Installing from docker-compose
Once you have Docker desktop installed you need to follow the next steps:
1. Launch Docker desktop
2. Download/clone github repository to your desktop
```
git@github.com:GonzaloAlcalaGD/capstone_project.git
```
3. Open a new terminal and cd until you reach the following path **./airflow**
4. Make sure you see the docker-compose.yaml with:
    - macOS : **ls**
    - Windows : **dir**
    - Linux : **ls -a**
6. Once you see the docker-compose.yaml file execute docker build
7. After Docker build finishes run docker-compose up
8. Wait until all containers are up and you see the following message:
` airflow-airflow-webserver-1  | 127.0.0.1 - - [25/Oct/2022:19:32:05 +0000] "GET /health HTTP/1.1" 200 141 "-" "curl/7.74.0" `
. Open your favorite web browser
9. Go to the following URL : **http://localhost:8080/home**


## Usage
Once steps are completed you should see the following website
![Airflow login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GonzaloAlcalaGD/data_generators/main/images/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-25%20at%2014.34.29.png)


Now you should be able to log into the Airflow webserver with the credentials inside the docker-compose.yaml, by default the credentials are 
```
USER : airflow
PASSWORD : airflow
```

Once you are inside the Apache Airflow webserver you must be able to see the following [DAG's](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/dags.html)
![Airflow DAGS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GonzaloAlcalaGD/data_generators/main/images/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-25%20at%2014.48.59.png)

To start the pipeline first you'll need to unpause all the dags like in the following image
![Airflow DAGS ON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GonzaloAlcalaGD/data_generators/main/images/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-25%20at%2014.57.30.png)

After all DAG's are unpaused you simply need to run the **generate_data** DAG to start the whole pipeline.

After the data generation completes all the following dags will get triggered in the following order:

1. load_and_normalize_data_headers
    - Data will be loaded into Spark Dataframes and headers will get normalized and will be saved into .parquet format
    - Trigger next pipeline step
2. unify_transform_enrich_data
    - Here .parquet data will be loaded and unified into a single Dataframe
    - Then it will perfom transformations for DataTypes in the unified Dataframe
    - Unified Dataframe will get enriched (We get rid of null values)
    - Transformed and enriched data will be saved into HDFS
    - Trigger next pipeline step
3. enriched_data_aggregations
    - Unified and enriched Dataframe will be loaded  
    - Perfomed aggregations Dataframes will be saved into HDFS

Data storage for .parquet files

All parquet files will be saved inside **./airflow/dags/storage/...**

Data stored inside HDFS can be accessed following the next steps

1. Open a new tab in your web browser
2. Go to the following link : **localhost:9870**
3. In the navbar click on **Utilities**
4. Go to **Browse the file system**
5. Data should be under the following directories
    - Data aggregations:
        - /aggregations/cities_transactions
        - /aggregations/online_offline
        - /aggregations/store_metrics
    - Transformed and enriched data:
        - /transformed_unified_and_enriched_dataframe
